*Tx Macros* are an aid for sending brief, frequently used free-text
messages such as the examples shown below.

- To add a new message to the list, enter the desired text in the
entry field at top, then click *Add*.

- Remember that a transmitted free-text message is limited to 13
characters, including blanks.

- To remove an unwanted message, click on the message and then on
*Delete*.

- You can reorder your macro messages by using drag-and-drop. The
new order will be preserved when _WSJT-X_ is restarted.

- Messages can also be added from the main window's *Tx5*
  field. Simply hit [Enter] after the message has been entered.

- If the first word of a message is $DXCALL (or the shortened form
$DX), that word will be replaced on transmission by the base callsign
in the *DxCall* field.
