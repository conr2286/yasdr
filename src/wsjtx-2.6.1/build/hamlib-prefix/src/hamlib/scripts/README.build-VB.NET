The build-VB.NET.sh script creates a binary ZIP archive of Hamlib compiled for
Win32 using the __stdcall interface for Visual Basic.NET 2002 Framework 1.1.

The release is possibly usable by other VB versions, but success has not
been reported to the Hamlib team.  The script is very similar to the
build-win32.sh script and has the same Prerequisites for development tools.
The differences are the use of sed(1) to edit include/hamlib.rig_dll.h for
__stdcall, output of a customized README.VB.NET-bin file, and naming of the
ZIP archive. See README.build-win32 for more information.

The Hamlib developers would appreciate help making Hamlib, and the binary
release generated by the script, usable by other versions of Visual Basic.
