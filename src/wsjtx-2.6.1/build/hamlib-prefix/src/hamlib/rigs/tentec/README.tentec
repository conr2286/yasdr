Jupiter (538)
    (29 February 2012, AA6E)
    The Jupiter needs current firmware, at least version 1,18.  Earlier
    firmware apparently had a different command protocol.
    Most available commands are now implemented, with exception of NB,
    NR, and AN.

Omni VI (563), VI Plus (564)
    (26 March 2008, AA6E)
    Note that the Omni uses an Icom-style command interface.  The Omni
    backend lives in the ../icom directory!
    Omni (hardware) menu selections: The Omni's device address must be 
    set to '04'.  The 563 and 564 provide 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, and 19200 
    baud rates.
    
    Notes on 563 (Omni VI) vs. 564 (Omni VI Plus)
        Omni VI Plus (Hamlib model 351) backend can be used with the Omni
        VI, subject to its hardware limitations.

Orion (TT 565, 565AT) and Orion II (TT 566, 566AT)
    (14 February 2008)
    Improved serial I/O transfer reliability, better error handling

    V1 and V2 firmware are autorecognized in the tt565_open routine.
    Version 2.xxx is now the default for Orion.
    (5 November 2007)
    
	The S-meter behavior has changed for Version 2.xxx of
	firmware for Orion.  Orion II presumably also has a different
	calibration.  We will recalibrate, but it is not clear
	if Orion and Orion II will produce the same readings. :-(
	Please send calibration info to me as indicated on the
	Hamlib FAQ at http://hamlib.sourceforge.net/faq.html .
	(23 April 2006)

	These are all covered by the TT565 backend (model 1608).
	This backend is functioning for basic HF work, although
	memory, multi-VFO, and antenna selection, etc. are
	left for the future.
	All testing to date has been on a model 565AT, running
	v 1.372 firmware.
	All reports of success/failure (especially for the Orion 2)
	are welcome -- Martin, aa6e@arrl.net
        (26 Feb 2006)

tt550 TODO (Ken,  N7IPB):
	Support for multiple VFO's and Memories.  The TT550 doesn't
	really have VFO's or Memories since it's strictly a software
	controlled radio, but they can easily be simulated in software.
	I already support a split mode since the TX and RX control is
	separate.  Adding support for VFO-A, VFO-B and memory channels 
	will be done next.

	The optional encoder with keypad is supported for changing frequency
	only, along with F1 changing the stepsize.  The other function keys
	have no current assignments.  I can add hard-coded Function keys as
	I did with F1 but maybe a more generic solution can be determined.

	In addition the keypad is not supported.  Hamlib has no apparent way
	to make use of the numeric keys.  We probably need to add a callback
	for key data.

	IF-Shift:  IF-Shift code is in place but I see no way in hamlib to make 
	use of it.  The Icom dual pass-band tuning is supported,  but not just
	simple IF shift.  Or maybe I just missed something.

	TX Audio Monitor Volume - no hamlib support - RIG_LEVEL_TX_MON?
	CW Sidetone Volume - no hamlib support - RIG_LEVEL_SIDETONE?
	Transmit Audio Source and Volume select - no hamlib support - RIG_LEVEL_LINEIN?
	CW Spot Level - no hamlib support - RIG_LEVEL_CW_SPOT?
	Enable/Disable Amplifier keying loop - no hamlib support - RIG_FUNC_AMP?
