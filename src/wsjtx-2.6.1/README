WSJT-X Superbuild
=================

This  package builds  the WSJT-X  application.  It  does not  directly
contain the source  files, instead it consists of a  CMake script that
builds the application  by fetching the sources  from their respective
source control repositories and then building the application.

WSJT-X  also has  a CMake  build system  but currently  it also  has a
dependency on a library called Hamlib which itself has to built from a
fork of the  official Hamlib project. The Hamlib fork  is used because
it  contains  the  latest  patches  not yet  accepted  by  the  Hamlib
development team.

This project combines he building of Hamlib and WSJT-X.  It also has a
two phase mode that builds a complete source package in phase one that
can then be transferred to another build host to be built in phase two
there. This two  phase mode is aimed at Linux  package maintainers who
have to have a complete upstream source package that can be built on a
restricted build  server. The intermediate source  tarball is released
by the WSJT-X team as a resource for conveniently building both Hamlib
and WSJT-X from sources
