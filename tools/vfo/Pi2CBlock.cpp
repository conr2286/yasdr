/**
 * Construct an optimized register block for I2C device at addr
 *
 * @param i2C		Pi2C bus
 * @param addr		7-bit I2C address of device
 *
 * This class constructs an object working with Pi2C to optimally send a
 * sequence of registers to the I2C device at addr through its sendRegister()
 * method.  All reguests to sendRegister() on an block object must address the
 * same I2C device.  However, the sendRegister()s may target registers within
 * that device in any order.  The close() method must be called after all
 * requests are complete.  Close() will flush the registers' data to the
 * device in sorted order, using burst mode when the requests target registers
 * in sequential order, else their data will be flushed through individual
 * transactions.
 *

/**
 *  Buffer <reg,data> to later send to i2cDevice
 *
 *  @param reg	I2C device register
 *  @param data	Value to write to that register
 *
 *  All requests to sendRegister() address the same device in this object.
 *  Each request consists of a <reg,data> tuple and may appear in any order (they
 *  need not be sequential registers).  Even gaps in the register sequence are
 *  permitted.  The data is actually sent to the device after close().
 *
 *  Note:  all invocations of sendRegister() by this object address the same
 *  I2C device configured in the constructor.
 *
 *  Caution:  Register data is written to the I2C device in sequential (by reg
 *  number) order, not the invocation order of sendRegister().  While this can
 *  improve performance over the I2C bus (through use of burst mode writes),
 *  some devices may require their register values to be assigned in invocation
 *  order, not in sequential register order.
