/**
   @file Optionally interrupt-driven Shaft Encoder implementation over the Arduino APIs
   
   @author  Jim Conrad, KQ7B

   Dependencies: This code was originally developed for the Yumo E6A2-CW3C (Sparkfun Part# COM-10932) 
   200 pulse/revolution quadrature shaft encoder, but likely will work with many
   quadrature encoders.  Designed for moderately slow rotation speeds, this code eschews
   direct access to GPIO pins to favor the modest processor independence provided by the 
   Arduino APIs.
   
   Operation:  Quadrature shaft encoders output two signals, referred to here as pinA and
   pinB.  The E6A2-CW3C signals are NPN open collector, and we arrange for the chip to supply
   the necessary pullup resistors on the two GPIO pins.  We decode the two-channel quadrature
   signal with the usual finite state machine (FSM).  When requested, the interrupt system
   drives the FSM, consuming two interrupt-capable digital pins (e.g. 2 and 3), expecting
   to track the encoder's position more accurately than polling alone. 

   Oddities:  The extensive use of static data/methods arises because the interrupt service 
   routine doesn't have a reference to "this" object.

//the encoder's quadature outputs read from digital pins, pinA and pinB.  The content of each table cell
//specifies the action to take in response to events in the current state.  The next-state is always the

  The encoder's interrupt service routine (ISR)
  
  The ISR is invoked by both the rising and falling edges of both quadrature signals (pinA and
  pinB).  The use of interrupts, when available, helps avoid invalid transitions by allowing
  the rotation of the encoder, rather than program polling alone, drive the FSM.  Sadly, some
  chips support very few external interrupts.

   Initialize the ShaftEncoder module 

   Quadrature encoders output two digital signals known here as pin_A and pin_B.  During clockwise
   rotation, transitions in the signal on pin_A leads those on pin_B.  Transitions can be detected
   either by polling (rapidly invoking getPosition()) or by enabling interrupts.  Note that some
   Arduinos have severe limitations on which pins can trigger external interrupts.  We initialize
   the encoder's current position to 0 but you can change it with setPosition().

   @param interruptEnable true requests interrupts on both pin_A and pin_B
