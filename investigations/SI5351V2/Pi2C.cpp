 *
 * Pi2C --- An interface to a an I2C device on the Raspberry Pi
 *
 * @author
 * 	Jim Conrad, KQ7B		Implementation for yasdr
 *
 * 	Pi2C constructs an interface to a Raspberry Pi I2C bus (the RPi 4 supports
 * 	several busses).  You will need one Pi2C object for each bus in use, but
 * 	one object can access any device on its bus.
 *
 * 	The constructor prepares the bus for access, after which you
 * 	may use the read/write methods to access device(s) on that bus.
 *
 * @section NOTES
 *  This implementation of the Pi2C class interface was originally developed for
 *  use with Raspberry Pi (RPi) 4 hardware supervised by bullseye and tested with
 *  the SI5351a chip.
 *
 *  The RPi supports several ways to access an I2C device.  The open/read/write
 *  approach binds a file descriptor to a specific device and lacks support for
 *  the I2C "Repeated START" (e.g. START, write register, START, read byte)
 *  operation.  The smbus approach supports "Repeated START" but binds the file
 *  descriptor to a single device rather than the bus.  The ioctl I2C_RDWR
 *  approach used here binds the open file descriptor (and hence a Pi2C object)
 *  to a bus, not a specific device, and also supports the I2C "Repeated START"
 *  feature required to read a specific register within an I2C device.
 *
 *  This implementation is currently limited to 7-bit device addressing.
 *
 *  This implementation is currently limited to operating as the bus Master
 *  on the Raspberry Pi.
 *
 *  Error handling could probably use some improvement, but given the target
 *  usage in an embedded systems... what can really be done beyond rebooting
 *  and hoping things go better in the next life.

 * @section NOTES
 * At this time, Pi2C joins the bus only as a controller, not as a slave.
 * At this time, the instantiated object is configured to access a single device on the
 * I2C bus.  Because I2C supports many devices on a single bus, we may someday implement
 * another constructor (sans the addr parameter) and another method for selecting an
