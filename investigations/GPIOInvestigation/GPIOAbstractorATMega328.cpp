/**
  Implementation of the General Purpose I/O (GPIO) abstractor for the ATMega328 MCU

  Provides a uniform interface through class methods, including attachInterupt(),
  similar to the Arduino core's similarly named functions, supporting pin change
  interrupts for all GPIO pins.  Note that the abstractor's interface is defined
  in GPIOAbstractor.h and this source file merely contains an implementation for
  a single MCU.

  Limitations:  Excepting digital pins 2 and 3, this implementation's support for the
  Arduino-defined interrupt modes is limited to RISING, FALLING and CHANGE.  The LOW
  and HIGH modes are not supported; requests for them are silently ignored.

  ATmega328:  This MCU classifies interrupts from GPIO pins as "external" or "pin change".
  The ATmega328 supports only two external interrupts on digital pins 2 and 3, but these
  may be triggered by a LOW, RISING, FALLING or any CHANGE in those pins' logic levels. The
  ATmega328 supports only CHANGE interrupts on the remaining GPIO ports.  The MCU maps
  those pins' bits into three ports, port B, C and D (note:  the ATmega328 lacks port A).  
  Each of these three ports has an interrupt vector in the hardware; they are PCINT0_vect
  (port B), PCINT1_vect (port C), and PCINT2_vect (port C).  When a pin serviced by one of
  these ports changes, the MCU invokes that port’s ISR which must determine which of the 
  8 pins serviced by that port caused the interrupt on that port.

  Implementation:  We implement the ISRs for all three GPIO ports here.  Each interrupt
  handler compares the current state of its port's pins with the saved state of those
  pins from the previous interrupt.  The changed pins are identified and the user's
  supplied interrupt vector(s) invoked as governed by the requested modes.
