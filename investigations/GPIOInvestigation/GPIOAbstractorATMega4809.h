  @file Device-Dependent Declarations for the ATMega4809 implementation of the GPIO Abstractor

  Implementation:  These declarations are #included by the device-independent GPIOAbstractor.h file.
  The ATMega4809 offers several GPIO enhancements over the venerable ATMega328:
    + 41 GPIO pins on the chipset though the Arduino Nano Every (and this implementation) exposes only D0..D21
    + Each pin supports Arduino interrupt modes, RISING, FALLING, CHANGE, and LOW
    + Each port has an associated INTFLAGS register indicating which pin triggered the interrupt
  The Arduino core supports interrupts on all digital pins for the Nano Every, so we pass the "real" 
  work to the core for implementation.  Our value added is merely the uniform interface declared by 
  the GPIOAbstractor that supports several MCUs.
