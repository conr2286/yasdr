/**
  Implementation of the General Purpose I/O (GPIO) abstractor for the ATMega4809 MCU

  Provides a uniform interface through class methods, including attachInterupt(),
  similar to the Arduino core's similarly named functions, supporting pin change
  interrupts for all GPIO pins.  Note that the abstractor's interface is defined
  in GPIOAbstractor.h and this source file merely contains an implementation for
  a single MCU.

  ATmega4809:  This MCU supports LOW, RISING, FALLING and CHANGE interrupt modes on
  all GPIO pins.  The MCU maps those pins' bits into six ports, port A, B, C, D, E and F.
  Each of these ports has an interrupt vector in the hardware.  When a pin serviced by
  any port changes, the MCU invokes that portâ€™s ISR which determines which of the 
  8 pins serviced by that port caused the interrupt on that by examining that port's
  INTFLAGS register.

  Implementation:  Since the Arduino core provides satisfactory support for the ATMega4809
  (e.g. the Arduino Nano Every), we merely pass through the "real" work to the core.  All
  we're doing is implementing the interface defined by the GPIOAbstractor.
